# Declarative grid-search enqueuer for scripts/queue_run.sh.
#
# A sweep is a list of "alias=hydra.param: candidate1 candidate2 ..." lines.
# The cartesian product (grid search) of all candidate lists is enqueued for
# every k in K_LIST. Run names are built automatically from the swept values:
#
#   - 1 candidate   -> fixed value, NOT in the run name
#   - 2+ candidates -> swept, run name gets _<alias><value>
#
#   e.g. TRM_SWEEP below produces run names like  k6_trm_halt16_H3_L6
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sigma_enqueue.sh [run_prefix]              # write job files
#   scripts/sigma_enqueue.sh --dry-run [run_prefix]    # print grid, write nothing
#   scripts/sigma_enqueue.sh [run_prefix] --dry-run    # same; order does not matter
#
# WARNING: with no --dry-run this writes real job bodies into scripts/queue/jobs/,
# where the runner can claim them immediately.  --dry-run is accepted in any
# position and an unrecognised flag aborts rather than being read as a prefix.
#
# Re-running appends after existing jobs (sequence numbers continue), so you
# can enqueue more sweeps while the runner is going.

set -euo pipefail

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Argument parsing.
#
# --dry-run is honoured in ANY position, and an unrecognised flag is a HARD
# ERROR rather than a run prefix.  Both halves matter, and the reason is an
# incident, not a style preference:
#
#   2026-08-06, `sigma_enqueue.sh pp --dry-run` was run intending a dry run.
#   The old parser tested only "$1" for --dry-run, so "pp" became RUN_PREFIX,
#   "--dry-run" was silently ignored as a stray argument, DRY_RUN stayed 0, and
#   216 real job bodies were written into the live scripts/queue/jobs/ where
#   they sat claimable by the runner for ~39 s before being pulled back out.
#
# A silently-swallowed flag on a script whose default action is "enqueue real
# training jobs" is a one-keystroke path to an unintended production launch, so
# anything starting with "-" that is not understood now stops the script.

# min ord(sigma) = the smallest order actually achievable above k, and

#
# The achievable orders in S_10 are {1,2,...,10,12,14,15,20,21,30}, which
# makes the pools coarser as k grows and produces two facts worth knowing
# before reading any k-sweep as a smooth curve:
#   k=1   -> ord>1  : sigma^1 = sigma, an identity-copy task; near-trivial.

# ---- Staged (one-factor-at-a-time) exploration, 2026-08-06 ----------------
# Replaces "enqueue the whole 378-cell cartesian product at once".
#
# Why. The full product spends most of its budget on cells whose answer is
# already implied by cheaper ones: k=1 is an identity-copy task, k=10 and k=11
# draw from an IDENTICAL pool (S_10 has no order-11 element), and the k>=12
# pools narrow monotonically. Meanwhile the phenomena actually under
# investigation -- the H-collapse band and the L3 non-monotonicity -- sit in a
# narrow mid-k window. A grid answers every question at the same low
# resolution; running one factor at a time answers the load-bearing ones first
# and lets each stage choose the next stage's k values.
#
# K_DIAG = the diagnostic k set the ABLATION stages sweep, deliberately much
# smaller than K_LIST. The default brackets the observed transition: 3 is
# reliably learnable, 5/6/7 is where collapse and non-monotonicity appear, 10
# is the far end. Override once stage 1 has told you where the real boundary
# is on THIS data generation -- that is the entire point of staging.
# WARNING (SP-04-L03 / G-20260813-inverse-learnability, 2026-08-13): do NOT
# extend K_DIAG to include 12 or 16 as a shortcut for covering the SP-04
# judgment cells. K_DIAG feeds the LIVE ablation_act / ablation_arch / tfb
# stages, which run under D1 semantics (epochs=50000, see the "2026-08-06:
# epochs 100000 -> 50000" comment above) -- but the SP-04 judgment protocol
# for k=12/16 is D0 + epochs=100000, a DIFFERENT budget on the SAME
# architecture cohort (tf_noz_iter). Folding 12/16 into K_DIAG would silently
# launch a wrong-protocol live run at those k values before the dedicated
# `invcells` stage (below) ever fires, producing two non-comparable results
# at the same k with no run_name collision to catch the mismatch
# (abl_*_k12_s1 vs pp_inv_tf_noz_iter_k12_s1 are different names, so
# enqueue()'s idempotency skip will NOT protect against this).

# 2026-08-06: z_snapshot flipped False -> True for the power_permutation
# generation. Rationale (design doc §4.2b): the open question is whether an
# H-collapse cell (train_exact~1.0, test_exact~0.0) is ALSO a representational
# collapse (low participation ratio) or a purely accuracy-side failure.
# `z/eff_rank` = PR(z_H) already answers that and is already logged -- the only
# thing missing was that the snapshot path was switched off. This is additive
# telemetry: z_snapshot only controls whether snapshots are written to
# checkpoint_path (pretrain.py `_snap_path`), it does not alter training or any
# existing metric. Legacy fig1 protocol-match is therefore preserved for every
# metric the old figures consume.
# 2026-08-06: per-eval prediction dump ENABLED (eval_save_outputs).
# Requested by intake 20260806T052122Z-c65f6d6d0f, which asks for a raw
# per-eval prediction artifact so that E_comm, valid-permutation rate and the
# d(k) trivial-position split can be computed ENTIRELY DOWNSTREAM -- keeping
# server-side metric code at zero lines. No new code was needed: the machinery
# already exists and was merely inert, gated on this one empty list.

#   pretrain.py:558-565    torch.save -> checkpoint_path/step_<N>_all_preds.<rank>
# It fires inside evaluate(), so it is independent of checkpoint_every_eval:
# dumps land at EVERY eval interval even though full weights are only written
# at the final iteration.
# Keys chosen: preds/labels/inputs/puzzle_identifiers -- enough to make each
# dump self-describing without a join back to the dataset. Deliberately NOT
# `logits` (vastly larger, and every requested statistic needs only the decoded
# sequence). Cost ~136 KB/eval, ~7 MB/run, ~2.6 GB across the 378-job grid.
# 2026-08-06: epochs 100000 -> 50000 (grid-search budget).
# `epochs` is NOT the optimizer step count. pretrain.py derives
#   total_steps = epochs * total_groups * mean_puzzle_examples / global_batch_size
# and with total_groups=5000, mean_puzzle_examples=1.0 (dataset.json) and
# global_batch_size=2048 (config/cfg_pretrain.yaml):
#   50000 -> 122,070 steps    (100000 -> 244,140;  10000 -> only 24,414)
# NOTE eval_interval is in EPOCHS, not steps (pretrain.py:717), so
# eval_interval=2000 gives epochs/2000 evaluations: 25 here, 50 before.
#
# Why 50000 and not less. Empirically, from the 31 runs in
# reports/figures/2026-08-04_ablation-backlog/ablation_terminal.csv that reached
# peak_test_exact >= 0.99, the step at which they peaked is strongly structured
# BY k -- and truncation therefore is not uniform noise, it is a k-dependent
# bias that manufactures a fake k-curve:
#     budget      k=5    k=6    k=7    total captured
#     24,414 st   0/3    0/3    0/4    15/31  (48%)   <- kills mid-k entirely
#     48,828 st   1/3    2/3    1/4    22/31  (71%)

#    122,070 st   3/3    3/3    3/4    30/31  (97%)   <- this budget
# k=5 (median peak 107,404 steps) only becomes whole at this budget, and k=5 is
# precisely the cell where the L3 non-monotone collapse was observed -- a
# shorter budget would kill the one cell the campaign most wants to read.
# The single remaining loss is one k=7 run peaking at 161,106; re-run that cell
# individually at a longer budget if it matters.
# Cost: ~1,142 GPU-h for the 378-job grid (~12 days on 4 GPUs), half of the
# 100000-epoch budget.
# CAVEAT: those 52 abl_* runs are cloud-only, so their data_epoch is `unknown`
# (not confirmed clean). The peak_step distribution is used here only as a
# measure of how long this task/architecture takes to converge, which is
# argued to be usable regardless of the ord-filter contamination question.
# NOTE the `+` on eval_save_outputs. It is a PretrainConfig field
# (pretrain.py `eval_save_outputs: List[str] = []`) but is NOT declared in
# config/cfg_pretrain.yaml, so Hydra's struct mode rejects a bare assignment
# with "Could not override 'eval_save_outputs' ... not in struct" and the job
# dies before the first step. Same reason log_z_dynamics/z_snapshot carry `+`.
# Caught 2026-08-06 by `--cfg job` pre-flight on a real enqueued body; the key
# was added to this line earlier the same day without the prefix, which would

#
# THE ONE THING TO KNOW BEFORE READING THIS AXIS (trm.py:207-216): the first
# H_cycles-1 outer cycles run under `torch.no_grad()`; only the last one is in
# the gradient path.  So define, per ACT step,

#     blocks applied  C = H_cycles * (L_cycles + 1) * L_layers

#
# That yields three distinct, individually well-posed questions instead of one
# muddled "depth" question:
#
#   (a) H1 / baseline / H6 hold G = 14 fixed and vary C by 6x.  This is NOT a
#       depth ladder -- it asks whether extra no-grad forward refinement helps
#       at all.  Well-posed as-is; do not read it as "more loops = deeper".
#   (b) The G-matched ladder pairs a params-FIXED recurrence arm against a
#       params-DOUBLING layer arm at each rung:
#           G ~  7-8 : L3   (6.83M) vs lay1 ( 3.42M)
#           G =   14 : baseline, the shared origin of both arms
#           G ~ 26-28: L12  (6.83M) vs lay4 (13.64M)
#           G ~ 50-56: L24  (6.83M) vs lay8 (27.28M)   <- the two new cells
#       L24/lay8 exist because the ladder previously stopped at rung 3, where
#       the params gap is only 2x; at rung 4 it is 4x, which is where a
#       weight-tying claim either survives or does not.
#   (c) tfb (below) supplies the no-recurrence arm.
#
# COST is NOT uniform across this list: runtime tracks C, so L24 (~3.6x
# baseline) and lay8 (~4x) are the two expensive cells.  lay8 is also the
# largest activation footprint in the campaign (G = 56 blocks kept for
# backward at global_batch_size=2048); if anything OOMs it is this cell, and
# it will land in scripts/queue/failed/ rather than corrupting its neighbours.

#         (G = 14 both).  Added 2026-08-06.  Without it the campaign can say
#         "recurrence beats a same-size stack" but cannot say anything about
#         a stack that is genuinely as deep, because tfb topped out at 6 --
#         and the answer costs 7x the parameters, which is the actual claim.
#
# Deliberately NOT included: lay26 (88,190,978 params) would match L12's
# G = 26, but an 88M-parameter model on 5,000 training examples is a
# different regime (capacity-saturated), so the comparison would confound
# depth with overfitting.  Matching trm baseline's C = 42 is worse still:
# ~42 distinct layers, ~140M params.  The compute-matched pure-transformer
# comparison is therefore OUT OF SCOPE by construction, not an oversight --
# say so when reporting rather than implying the sweep covers it.

# 2026-08-06 — TFB_CYCLES REMOVED. `arch.H_cycles` is a NO-OP for
# arch=transformers_baseline: in models/recursive_reasoning/transformers_baseline.py
# the identifier occurs exactly twice, at the docstring (L7, "REMOVED inner
# cycles (no H_cycles/L_cycles loops within reasoning)") and the pydantic field
# declaration (L52). The only range() in the file is over H_layers (L168), and
# Model_ACTV2ReasoningModule.forward (L109-116) applies each layer once with no
# cycle loop. So the old cyc1/cyc6 sweep built IDENTICAL models and burned half
# its budget on duplicates.
#
# What that accident may have measured is worth keeping. `abl_tfb_lay2_cyc1_k3_s1`
# and `abl_tfb_lay2_cyc6_k3_s1` reached final_test_exact 0.980 vs 0.164 (peak 1.0
# both). H_cycles occurs 0 times in pretrain.py / utils/ / models/layers.py /
# models/common.py -- only in the arch YAMLs, where transformers_baseline.yaml:9
# says "H_cycles: 1  # kept for compatibility" -- so parameter count, init path,
# LR schedule and total_steps are all independent of it, and the two runs were
# structurally the same model.
# CAVEAT: both runs are cloud-only (no local wandb dir, no local checkpoint), so
# their all_config.yaml could NOT be diffed directly, and "same seed" rests on
# the ablation CSV's seed column. Treat the 0.980/0.164 gap as strong evidence
# of run-to-run nondeterminism, not as confirmed.
# Either way the cycles axis had to go (it is a no-op), and spending that budget
# on a real seed axis is right under both readings: if the variance is real the
# seeds are required, and if it is not, the repeats explain what actually
# differed.

# Closes the "compute-matched looped stack is OUT OF SCOPE" gap noted at the

# transformers_baseline gained a weight-tied loop (models/recursive_reasoning/

#   arch.loops=N               re-apply the whole H_layers stack N times per forward
#   arch.loop_input_injection  re-add the input embedding at every loop (else loop 0 only)
#   arch.loop_grad_cycles=n    0 = full backprop; n>0 = no_grad for the first N-n loops
# With H_layers=2 and loops=21, C = 21*2 = 42 blocks per forward = the trm
# baseline's C (tf_z_iter: H3 L6 lay2), at lay2's 6,795,266 params (0.5% under
# trm's 6,828,034). Arms (each a one-factor contrast):
#   fullgrad : C=42, G=42  -- compute-matched, full backprop through every loop
#   g7       : C=42, G=14  -- ALSO gradient-depth-matched (TRM-style truncation:
#              last 7 loops = 14 blocks carry grad, like trm's last H cycle)
#   noinj    : C=42, G=42, input embedding added at loop 0 only -- isolates
#              TRM's per-step input injection
# What an ltf arm does NOT have relative to trm: the z_H/z_L two-state split
# and the L-inside-H schedule. That difference is the one being measured.

# With halt_max_steps>1 the inner model is re-applied up to halt_max_steps

# Halting: trm_singlez has NO act_enabled / act_inference fields

# ---- PERF-001 P0.1a: unprofiled benchmark preset (registered M2) ---------
# Closes PERF-DEV-14 ("no runnable M2 path ships"): before this, `--dry-run
# perf0` emitted the M3 profiler job only, so the M2 baseline the plan requires
# to run *as a queue job body* had nothing to enqueue.
#
# Field text is byte-identical to the registered M2 command in
# lab/reports/2026-07-26_experiment-speed-action-plan.md §P0.1a (lines 99-109),
# with the same two documented deviations as the M3 emitter above:
# (1) the job body never sets CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES — the queue worker owns it
# (queue_run.sh:165); (2) the body drops the operator-shell `rtk` prefix
# (PERF-DEV-16 in the 2026-07-28 ratification ledger of the same document).
#
# The timing contract registers three repeats r1..r3 with "seed=1 and same
# reserved GPU; repeat/seed/hardware differences are provenance, not pooled
# silently". This emitter discharges the repeat/provenance half ONLY: it emits
# three separate jobs whose +run_name=..._r<n> and
# perf_benchmark.output_dir=..._r<n> differ and whose every other field is
# identical, so the three repeats can never be silently pooled into one
# artifact set. The `_r<n>` suffix is the convention utils/perf_benchmark.py
# already parses — derive_condition_id() strips it to the shared condition,
# derive_repeat() reads the repeat index off it (see _REPEAT_SUFFIX and those
# two functions).
#
# The "same reserved GPU" half is NOT discharged here and is NOT recorded as a
# numbered deviation in the 2026-07-28 PERF-DEV ledger. Emitting three jobs
# gives no placement or ordering guarantee whatsoever: queue_run.sh:180-183
# spawns one independent worker PER GPU (default GPUS="4 5 6 7"), each worker
# claims the oldest job it can claim (queue_run.sh:144-146) regardless of which
# condition it belongs to, and runs it on its own device (queue_run.sh:165).
# With the default worker set, r1/r2/r3 are claimable concurrently by three
# workers on three different GPUs — three timing baselines contending for the
# same host CPU/PCIe/power while each measures steady state. A single-worker
# invocation does not fix this either: worker_loop takes the oldest job in the
# WHOLE FIFO, not the oldest perf0 job, so unrelated science jobs (and the M3
# profiler job emitted just above, which precedes r1) would interleave on the
# reserved device. Satisfying "same reserved GPU" is therefore an operator
# obligation at run time, outside anything this file can enforce, and the gap
# belongs to the pre-registration owner to number and rule on.
#
# PERF0_BENCH_DIR_BASE is deliberately UNprefixed (like PERF0_PROFILE_DIR):
# the registered artifact path is .../data/m2_tf_z_iter_k6_s1_r<n>, whereas the
# run name carries the `perf0_` queue prefix. Do not build one from the other.
